<p><b>Objective</b>: The main objective of this lab assignment is to learn and apply the knowledge of Version Control System using Git and Github platform to enhance effective collaboration on coding projects using Python programming language and Google Colab development environment, learn and implement the knowledge of some basic python libaries: Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib for data plotting and visualization, and lastly, to learn how to manage and modify project documentation.</p>

<p>In this project, we were tasked to develope a grading solution to modernize and streamline the management of student grades such that student's GPA can be efficiently tracked.
we worked with three csv files: studentGrades_English.csv, studentGrades_Math.csv, and studentHomerooms.csv, and basic data manipulation and visualization was done using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib to create Histogram and Scatter plots. The resultant tables, and plot images are all included in the project folder</p>
