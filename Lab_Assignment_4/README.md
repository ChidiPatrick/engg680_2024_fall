<p><b>Lab Objective</b>: This lab assignment focuses on applying machine learning to classify vehicle motion states—rest, straight driving, and turning—using onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data. We are tasked to train and tune machine learning models through grid search with cross-validation, apply Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification, and explore the impact of data quality and error sources on model performance. W were given three datasets for training, tuning, and testing: UrbanNav-HK_Whampoa-20210521_sensors.csv for training and hyperparameter tuning, UrbanNav-HK_TST-20210517_sensors.csv for first independent testing, and 2020-03-14-16-45-35.csv for second independent testing, enabling us to develop and evaluate robust models capable of handling real-world data variability.
